# Flappy Bird Clone - Unity Mobile Game üê¶

This is another game that I created in Unity using the C# programming language. There is no doubt that all of them know this game and have played it. This is a clone of the Flappy Bird Game. It is a fun and exciting game that requires precision timing to avoid obstacles. The obstacles are generated randomly, making the unpredictable and therefore more challenging. This is an endless game. It also has a simple control scheme that makes it easy to pick up and play.This game has the same functionality as Flappy Bird.
